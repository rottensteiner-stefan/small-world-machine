# Implementation Phase (`plan` Mode) — Verification Discipline

Extracted from `SKILL.md` Section 9. Applies exclusively to `plan` mode after `consensus.reached: true`. Cross-references refer to `SKILL.md`.

## 9. Verification Discipline (Consensus on Plan $\neq$ Working Implementation)

A lesson from production: `status: "consensus_reached"` (Section 6) confirms only that participants agreed upon a plan—it does not indicate whether the subsequent implementation works. These two states must never be conflated, neither in status fields nor in inter-agent communication.

### 9.1 Green Build/Lint/Unit Tests is NOT Runtime Behavior Verification

An agent may only mark an implementation item as **"✅ VERIFIED"** or **"✅ COMPLETED"** if validated by the tool truly responsible for the runtime target:
- `npm run build` / `lint` / `test` only verify static types and unit invariants. For code compiled/executed dynamically at runtime (shaders, generated queries, GPU pipelines, browser DOM lifecycle), a passing build says **nothing** about runtime validity.
- The agent making the change must state status specifically: **"Build/Lint/Test passing, runtime behavior not yet verified"** rather than a blanket `✅ VERIFIED`. Always name the tool validating the claim (e.g. "✅ Rendered in browser, zero console warnings").
- The QA/Reviewer agent assigned in the plan verifies independently using actual runtime tools rather than trusting green labels from peers.

### 9.2 The `[VERIFICATION_FAILED]` Marker

If the reviewer determines that an implementation does not meet acceptance criteria (runtime error, shader crash, visual glitch, specification drift):
1. **Mark Explicitly:** Post `[VERIFICATION_FAILED: <ReviewerAgent>] <Summary of issue with exact error stack/log>` in the topic document or blackboard finding.
2. **No Unilateral Fixes:** The reviewer does not fix the code unilaterally if assigned to another worker—report the finding and route it to the assigned developer.
3. **Plan Consensus Remains Intact:** `consensus.reached` remains `true`—the architectural plan itself is agreed upon. Only implementation completion is marked as open.
4. **Fixes Require Re-Verification:** A fix proposed by the developer is not automatically verified—it requires re-verification by the reviewer until `[VERIFICATION_PASSED: <ReviewerAgent>]` is confirmed.
5. **Counts Against Limits:** Implementation turns count toward round limits (`max_rounds`). If limits are reached, use `/collaborate --extend <N>`.

### 9.3 Implementation Turns & Formal Handover (`[ABNAHME_ERTEILT]` $\rightarrow$ `/collaborate --stop`)

After consensus, the protocol moves into the implementation and review cycle:
1. **Implementation:** The assigned developer agent implements the agreed code.
2. **Review & Runtime Verification:** The assigned reviewer performs runtime verification (look-dev, shader compilation, console inspection, WebGPU/WebGL parity).
3. **Formal Approval (`[ABNAHME_ERTEILT]`):**
   Once all criteria are verified (`[VERIFICATION_PASSED]`), the reviewer documents:
   ```markdown
   [ABNAHME_ERTEILT: <ReviewerAgent>]
   - All acceptance criteria satisfied.
   - Runtime behavior verified without errors.
   - Recommendation to Moderator: Close via `/collaborate --stop`.
   ```
4. **Closure by Moderator:** Only after approval is granted does the moderator execute `/collaborate --stop` to terminate the session (`status: "terminated"`).

### 9.4 Where the Implementation Runs: One Worktree per Session

The default is the shared checkout under the `session-mailbox` rules (claims, path-scoped commits). Use a **git worktree** instead when at least one of these holds:
- the work spans several milestones or sessions and may leave the tree red (lint, tests, build) for a while;
- it touches many shared files or tools that other people or sessions use at the same time;
- it is done by someone other than the moderator, or by another tool or agent family working in parallel.

`plan` and `decide` sessions only write board files and stay in the shared checkout.

**Granularity: one worktree (one branch) per session, never per worker.** The workers of a session share it and coordinate through the board and claims. A worktree per worker would turn live coordination into merge conflicts and cost a checkout and an install each.

One command does all of this: `npm run worktree:new -- <topic>` (`scripts/worktree-new.mjs`; `--dry-run` shows the plan, `--no-install` skips `npm ci`, `--base <ref>` and `--dir <path>` override the defaults). It works from inside another worktree too and always places the new one next to the main checkout. By hand (names are examples):
```bash
git worktree add ../<repo>-<topic> -b <topic>
cd ../<repo>-<topic> && npm ci
ln -s <main-checkout>/.agents/scratches .agents/scratches        # keeps the mailbox shared
echo '.agents/scratches' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude"
```
Run a dev server there on its own port.

Rules:
- **Stay current:** `git merge main` at milestone boundaries. Bring the branch back to `main` only after `[ABNAHME_ERTEILT]`, by merge or fast-forward. Pushing the branch needs the human's go like any other push.
- **Moving uncommitted work** out of the shared checkout needs the owner, with their agents and editors stopped: `git stash push -u -m <topic>-wip` there, check `git stash list` (yours must be `stash@{0}`), then `git stash pop stash@{0}` in the worktree. Never move someone else's files yourself.
- **Hot shared files** (`CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, ADR index) conflict at merge time. That is expected: resolve it at the merge, do not edit them on `main` to get ahead. `backlog.md` and the app `docs/log.md` journals are append-only and use git's `merge=union` (`.gitattributes`): parallel appends merge without a conflict, but skim the result (a clashing in-place edit is kept twice, and two entries added at the same spot may share a number).
- **Keep the claim:** the mailbox claim still names the paths the session owns.
- **Clean up** when the session is terminated: `git worktree remove ../<repo>-<topic>`, and delete the branch after the merge.
