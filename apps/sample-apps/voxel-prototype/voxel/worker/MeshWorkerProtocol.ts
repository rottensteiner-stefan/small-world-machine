/**
 * M1 worker protocol (`.agents/collaborate/minecraft/dossier.md` §4.2 M1 "MeshWorkerProtocol").
 * Typed, transferable message shapes between the main thread and the dedicated mesh worker
 * (`voxel/worker/mesh.worker.ts`). Single worker, two kept-apart roles (dossier §5 S2: world
 * generation and mesh building NEVER together, NEVER on the main thread):
 *
 *   - `generate`: the worker runs the seeded `TerrainGenerator` and returns a plain
 *     `Uint8Array` (SIZE³) that survives structured clone without class-prototype issues.
 *   - `mesh`: the worker runs the pure `buildMesh` against the chunk's own voxels plus the
 *     border planes of its neighbors (the seam culling contract, see `buildNeighborRim`).
 *
 * Deliberate simplifications for M1, documented (not hidden scope cuts):
 *   - No explicit transferable lists. The payloads are 4-6 KB per chunk; the worker keeps the
 *     main-thread `Chunk` data intact by receiving COPIEs, and the output arrays would be
 *     consumed exactly once anyway. Zero-copy would complicate ownership for no measurable gain
 *     at M1 scale (benchmarked later in M5).
 *   - One worker, one mesh task at a time. A worker pool is M5 hardening; M1 proves the
 *     architecture with a single background role.
